# Mock Volunteering Schedule Builder

This project is a Java application that generates daily task schedules for volunteers working at a mock wildlife rescue center. This project is a prime example of starting with a client definition and creating test-driven code. The project was created with fellow engineering students following a self-made timeline. This timeline started with a UML diagram created from a client definition, followed by a test suite to ensure object-oriented programming principles are obeyed. As the code is developed, continuous updating of the UML and test suite is adhered to follow code.

## How it Works

The application imports data from a given database and processes it to output tasks based on individual animal care requirements and volunteer shift schedules. It also incorporates a GUI to allow for user interaction. The project aims to automate the scheduling process that is currently done manually, which is prone to errors and time-consuming. The project helps volunteers prioritize animal care while maintaining an efficient schedule. 

## What I learned

The techniques and abilities developed through this project include designing and documenting an object-oriented Java application, connecting to databases, processing data, and creating GUIs. The project involved modeling, documenting, and testing the application to ensure that it meets the client's needs.
